Liquid Biopsy: Using DNA in Blood to Detect, Track, and Treat Cancer

Circulating microRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs foundin gene regulatory networks that aregrowing popular as biomarkers for human disease. The dataset is an aggregation of 21 datasets,each using microRNA profiles to predict some formof cancer. The two main contributors arefrom Sudo, et al., 2019 (‘JAMA Dataset’) and Yokoi,et al., 2018 (‘NatureComms Dataset’) andare summarized as follows.

In this project by using liquid biopsy, cancer types will be predicting by using machine learning techniques.
